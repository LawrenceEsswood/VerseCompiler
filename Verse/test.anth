~~~~~~~~~~| Range number |~~~~~~~~~~~
We start out with our long list
Beginning empty in out midst
Of our number we then think:
Take from number one, to shrink
But our list remains incomplete
So add another number to make the list beat.
The list is now done, so go to sleep!

~~~Begin~~~
Crazy counter for this part
With a ten here does start
And so the counter goes on:
Say the sum of "Hello " and counter
And take from counter one till its gone.

~~~| Greatest common divisor |~~~
Is this a less common divisor?
Then the greatest divisor is common instead!
On the other hand, does this divisor appear often?
Then so the greatest divisor does remain common, and this divisor too!
But then, how common does it stay!
